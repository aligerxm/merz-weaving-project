# The Merz-Weaving Project

## Artist Statement

"The Merz-Weaving" is a modular, participatory artwork that explores the principles of **Ville Spatiale**—creating flexible, ever-changing spaces through the assembly of reusable lamellar sheets. The work embodies a critique of static, traditional architecture, advocating instead for a dynamic, user‑driven environment that can be continuously reconfigured.

Drawing on the tradition of **Merz‑work**—the repurposing of found and discarded materials—each component is designed for reusability and adapts to new configurations over time. The project rejects the notion of a fixed monument, favoring a living, mutable structure that evolves with its participants.

Central to the piece is the idea of **moebian structures**: continuous surfaces formed by twisting and folding lamellar elements, creating non‑hierarchical, fluid spaces that challenge conventional spatial logic. By providing simple, reusable modules and a novel junction system, "The Merz‑Weaving" invites collaborators to build, unbuild, and rebuild—transforming the act of assembly into an ongoing artistic practice.

This repository serves as the conceptual notebook and technical documentation for the project, treating each design iteration as a version‑controlled development cycle.
