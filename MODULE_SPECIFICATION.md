# Module Specification: Lamellar Sheet

## Physical Properties

### Material
- **Primary Material:** Recycled polypropylene (PP) sheets, sourced from industrial offcuts and post‑consumer packaging.
- **Thickness:** 2 mm (±0.1 mm)
- **Surface Finish:** Matte, non‑reflective; lightly textured to improve grip and diffuse light.
- **Color:** Neutral grey (RAL 7030) to maintain visual coherence while allowing for eventual weathering and patina.

### Dimensions
- **Length:** 1200 mm
- **Width:** 400 mm
- **Edge Profile:** Rounded edges (radius 3 mm) to prevent injury and facilitate handling.
- **Weight:** Approximately 1.2 kg per sheet.

### Structural Characteristics
- **Flexibility:** Designed to bend along the long axis with a minimum radius of curvature of 500 mm without permanent deformation.
- **Rigidity:** Sufficient torsional stiffness to maintain planar integrity when suspended or cantilevered.

## Connection System

### Primary Connection Points
Each sheet is equipped with a standardized array of connection points that allow for reversible, tool‑free assembly.

- **Positioning:** Connection points are located along the four edges of the sheet, spaced at 200‑mm intervals (see diagram below).
- **Type:** Each point consists of a reinforced circular aperture (diameter 25 mm) surrounded by a recessed collar.
- **Count:** 6 points per long edge, 2 points per short edge (total of 16 connection points per sheet).

### Fastening Mechanism (Baseline)
- **Connector:** A simple, reusable plastic clip that snaps into the 25‑mm aperture, securing two sheets in a coplanar or perpendicular orientation.
- **Limitation:** The baseline clip only permits connections at 0° (in‑plane) or 90° (orthogonal) angles, forming rigid, grid‑like assemblies.

## Design Intent
This lamellar sheet is the fundamental, reusable building block of “The Merz‑Weaving.” Its dimensions and connection pattern are optimized for human‑scale manipulation while providing enough structural redundancy to support complex, multi‑layer aggregations. The use of recycled polypropylene aligns with the Merz‑work philosophy of re‑purposing discarded materials, and the modular geometry anticipates future iterations of more flexible, non‑hierarchical junction systems.
